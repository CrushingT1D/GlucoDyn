# GlucoDyn
GlucoDyn was created to educate T1D's and their caregivers about blood sugar dynamics

Each day T1D's make decisions about what and when to eat, and how much insulin to use to cover carbohydrates effect. It can be difficult to visualize what is happening throughout the day as carb absorption raises blood sugar and insulin reduces it – particularly when multiple events interact with one another.

GlucoDyn uses calculations similar to an insulin pump’s bolus wizard ( see the Background section for details on the calculations ) to create graphs of blood sugar versus time, based on your inputs of carb and insulin events.

The user can enter carb events, boluses, and temp basals, and GlucoDyn calculates the effect on blood sugar over time.

Seeing the curves and understanding the effects of bolus timing, carbohydrate absorption rate GI value, temp basal timing and rates, etc. will help users with their overall understanding of Type 1 diabetes and its management.

GlucoDyn also allows the user to “slide” the events around once they have been entered – allowing you to see what would have happened to your blood sugar curve if you had bloused earlier or eaten a different amount of carbs “on the fly” – the curves change as you move the sliders.
